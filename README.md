## Hi, I'm TheWorldJar

<!--
**TheWorldJar/TheWorldJar** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- I've been coding in C++, C#, Python, and JavaScript/TypeScript for over 4 years.
- I'm primarilly a game and backend developper.
- I'm a [Boot.Dev](boot.dev) and [Algonquin College](https://www.algonquincollege.com) alum.
- I'm learning Phaser at the moment, and want to expend into Rails in the future.
